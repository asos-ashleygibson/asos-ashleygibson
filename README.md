### Hey, I'm Ash 👋

#### 💻 My Team 

#### Aurora

Currently, I'm working on a Stock Reconciliation project which allows us to have greater visibility of any Stock discrepancies.

#### 💡 I’m currently learning...

Azure and Databases.

I have a keen interest in Microsoft Azure and serverless, cloud computing. Databases are also my weak point so I'm brushing up on my SQL knowledge for creating Stored Procedures and tSQLt skills for testing.

#### 📚 I'm currently reading...

[Continuous Delivery](https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html "Continuous Delivery") by Jez Humble and David Farley.

I love this book because it gives a detailed insight into how to create a fully working Continuous Delivery process no matter how big or small your project is.

[O'Reilly Programming C# 8.0](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-c-80/9781492056805/ "O'Reilly Programming C# 8.0") by Ian Griffiths.

This book is great for brushing up on my C# skills and as a reference book.

#### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on...
